Thinking in Systems
===================


Strange that this book was put on hold at the MSU library. Who is using it to teach?



Types of feedback loops:

balancing feedback loop - feedbacks encourage stock to reach an 
equilibrium. 

reinforcing feedback loop - more stock generates more stock
-> exponential, nonlinear growth

Feedback - interconnections in the system - can fail for many reasons, 
arrive late, in the wrong place, unclear, incomplete, too weak, delayed,
resourced constrained, or ineffective. 

Instead of seeing how only **A** influences **B**, consider how **B** 
might also influence **A**. 




The Question: What systems are at play in my current scenario?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In particular, for help and documentation. If someone has a problem
and finds success by directly reaching out, via email or chat, to a specific
person, are they then more likely to look for help in the same way in
the future?  |rarr| feedback loop.

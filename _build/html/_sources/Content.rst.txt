Content
=======


This section focuses on content. 

It should cover topics like style and audience.



Addresses questions such as:
    How to learn the information I need without taking time 
    from engineers who write the code? 



Collect information from online discussion forum and chats. Develop
a system of categorizing this information (sounds like an ML problem!).
Use these categories to identify areas of the documentation that need
additional attention. 

What's the best way to do this? 

Would need to save a collection of cut and pasted text files. Some will
be a chat between two people, some may be chats between multiple people. 
Also, forwarded and direct emails would need to be included.

I imagine this will be the most valuable content.

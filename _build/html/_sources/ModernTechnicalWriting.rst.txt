Modern Technical Writing
========================

| Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation 
| by Andrew Etter


This is my favorite book so far. Modern Technical Writing is a good example of
writing enough but not too much. It covers all the major topics succinctly
and keeps a good pace. Most important, Andrew Etter seems to have a very
good prescriptive on technical writing with pointed and useful advice
where it matters.

| Some Important Points:                                                           |
+==================================================================================+
| | It's difficult to qualitatively judge writing. The more you can back up        |
| | your qualitative judgements with quantitative analysis the better.             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| | Technical writers, first and foremost, are testers and researchers. Your       |
| | job is to know what people want to achieve and precisely how to achieve        |
| | it. Communicating that knowledge is the last step of the process and           |
| | really shouldn't comprise more than 10% of your time.                          |

| | The learning process is time-consuming, so don't be discouraged if your        |
| | measurable output is essentially nil for days or even weeks after moving       |
| | onto a new project.                                                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| | What is the product? Why would anyone want it?                                 |
| |                                                                                |
| |   These two questions are incredibly challenging for the average technical     |
| |   writer, a group of people much more focused on *how* than *what* or *why*... |
| |   if you can't answer these questions, you need to go back to the research     |
| |   phase, because you don't understand your audience at all. The answer to      |
| |   this question...should be an honest, buzzword-free appraisal of              |
| |   capabilities and use cases.                                                  |

Look thumbs! For quick feedback on pages include this on 
footer for each page. 

.. raw:: html

   <button type="button"
   onclick="document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = Date()">
   &#128077;</button>
   <button type="button"
   onclick="document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML = Date()">
   &#128078;</button>
   <p id="demo1"></p>
   <p id="demo2"></p>

Right now this only shows the date.

Just got the Moonlander split ergo keyboard. Typing is painfully 
slow and my fingers are starting to feel funny, but I love it. Minus
the awkwardness, it feels great to type on. Also, I'm realizing I was 
never a very good typist in the first place.

This change is just a test.

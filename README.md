# Whats Up Doc: Documentation About Learning Documentation

### Prologue 

Here I embark on a project to document my thoughts and learning about documentation of scientific software. 
My goal is collect and summarize as I learn more and formulate my ideas. Therefore this doc will have two 
sections. A working edge, we're my I keep my current thoughts and a more polished section where I apply 
what I learned to explain my approach to documentation. Right now eveything is the working edge! 

## Books I'm Reading

* Docs Like Code, by Anne Gentle
  * Note: I started by skipping directly to the Tutorial section.
* Thinking in Systems: A Primer, by Donella H. Meadows
  * For a perspective on challenges and solutions for current scientific software documentation.

## Useful Website
[Write the Docs!](http://www.writethedocs.org)


## Bleeding Edge

Develop the code to render this as a beautiful website.
Contribute something everyday! 


## Currently Underdevelopment

Using jekyll to make a plain text to html website update system. 

## TODO:

* Add links to example documentation.
* Summarize thoughts on some of their youtube tutorials.
* Add book.
* Continue to map-out the system. Focus on difference between User-Developer in general versus scientific software. For one, the average scienific user will likely interact with the code on a much more primative basis than a normal code user. So how does this affect the user vs. developer difference.

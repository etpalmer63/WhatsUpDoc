Thinking in Systems
===================


Strange that this book was put on hold at the MSU library. Who is using it to teach?



Types of feedback loops:

balancing feedback loop - feedbacks encourage stock to reach an 
equilibrium. 

reinforcing feedback loop - more stock generates more stock
-> exponential, nonlinear growth

Feedback - interconnections in the system - can fail for many reasons, 
arrive late, in the wrong place, unclear, incomplete, too weak, delayed,
resourced constrained, or ineffective. 

Instead of seeing how only **A** influences **B**, consider how **B** 
might also influence **A**.

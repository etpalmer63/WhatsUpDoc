Random Thoughts
===============

What goes here?


Spellcheck
----------

For spellchecking documents, the command line tool aspell works well. Use:

.. code-block:: 

   aspell -c <filename>


Robot Proofreader
-----------------
   
For proofreading ChromeVox. However, it can get tedious quickly. I wish
it had a more accessible on/off button.

Automation
==========



What things can be automated to make producing good docs easier? 


Implemented so far:

1. GitHub Workflow - checks for successful build. 


What else could be done:

1. Count misspelled words with custom dictionary. 
2. Grammar errors.
3. Some style aspects, such as capitalizing code names or acronyms.

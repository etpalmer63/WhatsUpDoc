Random Thoughts
===============

What goes here?


Spellcheck
----------

For spellchecking documents, the command line tool Aspell works well. Use:

.. code-block:: 

   aspell -c <filename>

Only one file name can be specified at a time. Therefore, a bash script
will be needed to loop through the files. 

It's also possible to add your own dictionary, see man aspell. 


Robot Proofreader
-----------------
   
For proofreading ChromeVox. However, it can get tedious quickly. I wish
it had a more accessible on/off button. 





Code Testing For Docs
---------------------

To learn more about Github's automated testing, new features are coming:

* auto spellcheck using custom dictionary
* code compile test 
* auto html build

|:+1:| Recently added GitHub workflows to test build upon push to main. 


Things Each Page Should Include
-------------------------------

A list of the most relevant files which are covered by the documentation.
A date when that documentation was last updated.
Feedback: A Thumbs Up/Down, Comment thing. -- What's the easiest way to 
do this?


*Feedback* |rarr|  Methods for automatically tracking? Are page views enough. Would it 
be helpful to know where people start. Or is number of views enough.

**Prologue**

Here I embark on a project to document my thoughts and learning about documentation of scientific software. 
My goal is collect and summarize as I learn more and formulate my ideas. Therefore this doc will have two 
sections. A working edge, we're my I keep my current thoughts and a more polished section where I apply 
what I learned to explain my approach to documentation. Right now eveything is the working edge!

==========================
Currently Underdevelopment
==========================
Using reStructuredText and Sphinx to make this website!

*TODO:*

* Add links to example documentation.
* Summarize thoughts on some their Youtube tutorials.
* User-Developer differences. 
* Automated dates for last time code was updated and last time documentation was updated. Also, graphical representation? 


*Ideas:*

Gallery of projects using the code with a short description accompanying each example. This way people can search
through others work to find examples, and people can promote their own work. 

Auto-glossary for in-house terms. Special terms are developed in-house for ease of communication. This facilitates in-house development and should be kept, but an auto-glossary for these terms would help incoming audience. 

Audience definitions should include our own development team, and users as technically literate but unfamiliar. Audience definitions? 

What about spell cehck?

Agile Documentation
===================

Has the longest title. How agile is that? 


light-but-sufficient

Is this better than *comprehensive* vs. *relevant* ? I suppose the question
is that at what point would someone be better served by reading the code 
themselves. 


Documentation aids communication, enhances knowledge transfer, preserves
historical information and fulfils government and legal requirements. 


Document should fulfil a purpose for its intended readers. 


Book is mostly presented in a problem, forces, solution, discussion format.
The problem is the problem statement. Forces provide background information
on the problem so that one can understand better the sources of conflict. 
Solution concisely states the approach to solve the problem. Discussion
then is designed to allow for general commentary on the complete scenario, 
which the author calls a 'pattern'.

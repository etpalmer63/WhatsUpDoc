**Prologue**

Here I embark on a project to document my thoughts and learning about documentation of scientific software. 
My goal is to collect and summarize as I learn and formulate ideas. Therefore this doc will have two 
sections. A working edge, where I keep my current thoughts and a more polished section, where I apply 
what I learned to explain my approach to documentation. Right now everything is the working edge!

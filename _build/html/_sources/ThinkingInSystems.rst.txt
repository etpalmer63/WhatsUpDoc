Thinking in Systems
===================


Strange that this book was put on hold at the MSU library. Who is using it to teach?



Types of feedback loops:

balancing feedback loop - feedbacks encourage stock to reach an 
equilibrium. 

reinforcing feedback loop - more stock generates more stock
|rarr| exponential, nonlinear growth

Feedback - interconnections in the system - can fail for many reasons, 
arrive late, in the wrong place, unclear, incomplete, too weak, delayed,
resourced constrained, or ineffective. 

Instead of seeing how only **A** influences **B**, consider how **B** 
might also influence **A**. 




The Question: What systems are at play in my current scenario?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In particular, for help and documentation. If someone has a problem
and finds success by directly reaching out, via email or chat, to a specific
person, are they then more likely to look for help in the same way in
the future?  |rarr| feedback loop. 

Conversely, if the documentation is good. Does that mean people will use it.
And if they find it useful will they be incline to go back to it? 

This seems to make the case for having excellent getting started 
documentation for first time users. In a sense that, if they 
find the documentation useful in the start, they will be more 
likely to return.

| Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content That Works
| by Janice (Ginny) Redish
    

This book gets into the details about properly preparing content for 
web consumption. Like Modern Technical Writing, the principals it argues

easy and quick to access. Worth it. 



They want to read only enough to meet their needs.

Write so that busy people can grab the information they need

- Headings to break up bodys of text
- Active space for visual simplicity
- Bullet point lists 
- Tables and images

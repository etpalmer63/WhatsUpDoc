Random Thoughts
===============

What goes here?


Spellcheck
----------

For spellchecking documents, the command line tool aspell works well. Use:

.. code-block:: 

   aspell -c <filename>


Robot Proofreader
-----------------
   
For proofreading ChromeVox. However, it can get tedious quickly. I wish
it had a more accessible on/off button. 



Content and Feedback
--------------------

Addressing questions:

1. How to learn the information I need without taking the time of 
   engineers who write the code?
2. How to generate feedback from users without taking their time
   and effort? 


Collect information from online discussion forum and chats. Develop
a system of categorizing this information (sounds like an ML problem!).
Use these categories to identify areas of the documentation that need
additional attention. 

What's the best way to do this? 

Would need to save a collection of cut and pasted text files. Some will
be a chat between two people, some may be chats between multiple people. 
Also, forwarded and direct emails would need to be included. 





Code Testing For Docs
---------------------

To learn more about Github's automated testing, new features are coming:

* auto spellcheck using custom dictionary
* code compile test 
* auto html build



Things Each Page Should Include
-------------------------------

A list of the most relavant files which are covered by the documentation.
A date when that documentation was last updated.
Feedback: A Thumbs Up/Down, Comment thing. -- What's the easiest way to 
do this?
